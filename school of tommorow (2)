    <h1>School of Tomorrow - Group Summary with Roasts</h1>

    <div class="profile">
        <h2>1. Alador</h2>
        <p>The tallest member of our group, with a chiseled 6-pack and natural charm that makes him a magnet for the ladies.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Alador’s so tall, he can high-five the ceiling without even trying.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He might attract the girls, but let’s be honest—it’s only Maramawit and Sunper who keep showing up.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: His abs are legendary, but the only thing they’ve won him are comments from Maramawit asking, “Can you reach that for me?”</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Alador’s so confident about his looks, but even Sunper knows his best angle is when he's walking away.</p>
        <p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.NVI1gVVLQRBU7Gkt0mg0BgHaLH?w=115&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.4&pid=1.7" alt="Alador's Image" width="500"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile">
        <h2>2. Matias</h2>
        <p>Tall (though not as much as Alador), with a strong build and known for his fighting skills. He’s the guy you don’t want to mess with.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Matias fights so much, even his shadow stays away from him.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He’s strong enough to fight anyone, except his Wi-Fi when it decides to act up.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: His fighting skills are top-notch, but he still fights his phone's autocorrect every day.</p>
        <p><img src="https://vault.si.com/.image/ar_1:1,c_fill,cs_srgb,fl_progressive,q_auto:good,w_1200/MTY5MTQ4MTcwNjE5MDA0Mzc5/1965-0525-muhammad-ali-sonny-liston-ii-001292890jpg.jpg" alt="Matias's Image" width="500"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile">
        <h2>3. Aleph</h2>
        <p>As tall as Matias but with a less-than-perfect hairline. Not exactly winning beauty contests, but he brings a unique charm to the group.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Aleph’s hairline is so far back, it’s practically running from him.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He says looks don’t matter, and good thing they don’t because he’d be in trouble.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Aleph’s so committed to being ugly, even his reflection sighs before showing up.</p>
        <p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.I-JUEWNs2rNHg-keNyV3GwHaFp?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain " width="500"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile">
        <h2>4. Abenezer</h2>
        <p>The runner of the group who never gets tired and is known for pulling serious pranks.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Abenezer runs so much, we’re convinced even his problems can’t catch up to him.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He’s so fast, but the only thing slower is his reply to messages.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: His pranks are so serious, we’re still trying to figure out if his last joke was actually a compliment or an insult.</p>
        <p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.-hehtP5GmWbuHmDZ8vxt-AHaFB?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Abenezer's Image" width="500"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile">
        <h2>5. Dagim</h2>
        <p>Short but extremely fast and known for having a temper. You don’t want to be around when he’s angry.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Dagim is so fast, by the time you blink, he’s already mad at you for blinking.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: His temper’s so quick, even a match takes longer to ignite.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He may be short, but his anger makes him look 10 feet tall.</p>
        <p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.4891cb368a06bc564aa50d73ba8bfb65?rik=l0jlARRZ8ZVKng&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="Dagim's Image" width="500"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile">
        <h2>6. Nathan</h2>
        <p>The most average guy in the group. Not exactly setting any records, and he can't do a push-up but can manage a pull-up.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Nathan is so average, even the Wi-Fi ignores him.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He says he's got strength, but the only thing he’s lifting is the group's spirit... barely.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: The only thing he's pulling up is our patience when he says, "I’ll do it next time."</p>
        <p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.KdBSw8TPL34eU6T7bjhpAAHaLH?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Nathan's Image" width="500"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile">
        <h2>7. Nolawi</h2>
        <p>Shorter than Dagim, but he's the chill guy of the group. An anime nerd and proud fanboy.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Nolawi’s so short, he looks up to even Dagim... and that’s saying something.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He’s the chill guy, probably because he’s saving all his energy for his next anime binge.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Nolawi’s anime obsession is so deep, we’re pretty sure he dreams in subtitles.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He’s convinced he’s living in an anime, but the only action scene he gets is when he has to reach for the top shelf.</p>
        <p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.usyvbkpyrgNCFh4FFNf2kwAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Nolawi's Image" width="500"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile">
        <h2>8. Nahom</h2>
        <p>The “betrayer” of the group. Known for his charm and for being loved by Wudasse, though the group has their doubts.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Nahom’s loyalty is as reliable as a Wi-Fi signal in a basement.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: He’s so “loved” by Wudasse, but we’re pretty sure it’s just a plot twist waiting to happen.</p>
        <p class="roast">Roast: Betrayal level: unlocked. Nahom's so smooth, even butter takes notes from him.</p>
        <p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.IVGSdr-ggZxG8fJfF9b7HAHaEh?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Nahom's Image" width="500"></p>
